# Bluetooth-Messenger


##    Why would I use this?


If you've ever seen a religious Apple user, you've probably been at least jealous
of their integration. This project brings a degree of the messaging capability
between iphones and osx computers to the pc and droid. By establishing a bluetooth
connection between your phone and your computer, these applications will allow you
to text from your computer. The only time you have to take the phone out of your pocket
is to open the app to connect to your PC. As of right now, the application supports
the following:

-Android 5.0 and Up (Only tested on 5.0 currently)
-Windows Vista and Up (Only tested on Windows 10 currently)
-Contact matching so computer application displays name of person you are messaging
-Previous Messages display so you can see all prior text messaging history on PC side
-Message deletion so upon disconnection, all messages saved on computer delete in order
	to preseve privacy.
