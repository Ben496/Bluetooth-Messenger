	<h1>C# Coding Style</h1>
	<p>
		This is not an all inclusive document on coding style that should be used.
		The purpose of this document is to cover the most common situations and
		show the general patterns. For frequent situations
		that are not contained in this document they will be decided then.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				All indention will be done with tabs. Spaces are not ment to be used for indention.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				All class, function, and variable names will be descriptive.
				They should accurately describe what it refers to.
				This means that variable/object/class names should be noun (subject) based and
				functions should be verb (predicate) based. Variables should not contain abbreviations,
				this is to prevent confusion between meanings of the abbreviation. Temporary variables however
				can be abbreviated. Thus <code>tmp</code> is ok to use but <code>delItem</code> should not be
				used instead of <code>deleteItem</code>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>All local variable names will be camelCase.</p>
			<pre><code>
void createConversation();
int createId;
			</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>All member variables will begin with an "_" and use camelCase.</p>
			<pre><code>
private int _count;
			</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>All properties will refer to one or more member variables.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>All class, property, and function names will be PascalCase.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Opening braces should never be on a new line, instead always place them at
				the end of the previous line with a space between the brace and the previous code.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Closing braces should always be on a line of their own. If, for example, you have an if else statement it should
				be like this:
				<pre><code>
if (x == y) {
	return x * y;
}
else if (y != 0) {
	return x / y;
}
				</code></pre>
				The reason that this is the case is to improve readability when using folding. This way you can fold
				individual elements of the if statement (or other statement) and not get confused as to what code
				relates to what condition.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				All binary operators (+, -, *, /, &&, ||, ...) must have a space on either side of the operator.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				All unary operators must be touching the value that they operate on. Ex: <code>i++</code>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				There will never be a space on the inside of parentheses. Ex: <code>(x + 3) / 2;</code>
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
